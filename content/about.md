# Who We Are
whoweare: "We are proudly locals who were born and raised in Ucluelet. We saw the need for a rental store in January of 2007 and we've opened for business. We recognized the need not only for a rental store but also a “Roll Off Service”. We appreciate both our local and out of town contractors with their continued support that has allowed us to grow. We take pride in offering a service based business and attempt to surpass you expectations."
