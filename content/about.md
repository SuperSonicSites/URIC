# Who We Are
whoweare: "We are proudly locals who were born and raised in Ucluelet. We saw the need for a rental store in January of 2007 and we've opened for business. We recognized the need not only for a rental store but also a “Roll Off Service”. We appreciate both our local and out of town contractors with their continued support that has allowed us to grow. We take pride in offering a service based business and attempt to surpass you expectations."

His family travelled from Quebec back in the mid-1960’s, as they saw the opportunity to thrive and build a life on the west coast. His biggest passion is to see his community thrive."

When Trudy is not in the office you can often find her enjoy a nice cold beverage with friends, family and Robby Lee (her husband)."
