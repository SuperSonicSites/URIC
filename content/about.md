# Who We Are
whoweare: "We are proud locals who were born and raised in Ucluelet. We saw the need for a rental store over a decade ago and opened for business. We recognized the need for not only a rental store but also a “Roll Off Service” and equipment sales. We truly appreciate our local and out of town contractors, West Coast residents and Families for their continued support that have allowed us to grow. We take pride in offering a family run service based business and are always striving to surpass your expectations."

His family travelled from Quebec back in the mid-1960’s, as they saw the opportunity to thrive and build a life on the west coast. His biggest passion is to see his community thrive."

She runs a tight ship and keeps Ucluelet Rent It Center running like a well oiled machine. When Trudy is not in the office you can often find her enjoy a nice cold beverage with friends, family and Robby Lee (her husband)."
